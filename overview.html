				<h3>Overview of the Season</h3>
				<h2>ADVENT: WALKING TOWARDS THE LIGHT</h2>
				<p>Advent may seem simple enough to understand as a period of preparation for the great Feast of the Lord's Nativity.  But the themes that emerge from the liturgical texts of the Roman Liturgy - the antiphons, collects, readings, psalms, prefaces - present a season that is altogether unique and profound.  There is nothing quite like it in the liturgical traditions of the East.  Certainly they do have their own special periods of preparation for Christmas and Epiphany but nothing the same as Advent.</p>
				
				<h2>THE ORIGINS OF ADVENT</h2>
				<p>The first signs of what we now call "Advent" appeared in the latter part of the 300s in the Christian communities of Spain and Gaul (present-day France and parts of Germany).  It was in some places a two to three-week preparation for the rites of Christian initiation celebrated in these regions at the feast of Epiphany.  This preparation seems to have involved not only those who were going to be baptised but also in various ways the whole community.</p>
				
				<h2>CHRIST, THE UNCONQUERED LIGHT OF THE WORLD</h2>
				<p>But why choose the Epiphany and not the Easter Vigil as the most auspicious time for conferring the sacraments of Initiation?  The simplest and shortest answer to this is to point to the theme of Light and the belief that Baptism means to be enlightened by Christ.  And in the northern hemisphere, the Christmas/Epiphany season depends upon the event of the winter solstice, when the sun begins its "ascent", the days begin to get longer, and the darkness is "conquered" by the Light of Christ.  According to the old calendars this winter solstice was calculated as taking place on 25 December, and not, as our modern calendar determines, 21 December.  So from the early 300s in Europe, Christmas was made to coincide with the solstice because it meant that Christ the Light had come into our world and would continue to conquer the darkness of sin, year after year - the Christ, the Son of God, our Saviour.</p>
				<p>Gradually, as time went on, the custom of group Baptism at Epiphany waned.  But the theme of baptism and conversion of heart, mind, and action remained embedded in the character of this special time.  In time, Advent took on the character familiar to us, as preparation for the feast of the Lord's coming in the flesh.  Its length varied from six weeks to four weeks depending on regional customs, until it reached its present fixed form of four weeks.</p>
				
				<h2>ADVENTUS - MOMENTOUS ARRIVAL OF SALVATION</h2>
				<p>The word "Advent" itself has an interesting background.  Both the Latin "Adventus" (Coming) and its Greek equivalent "Parousia" (Appearance) were both originally secular, pagan words which epitomised singular events such as the birth of an Emperor or the proclamation of the Victor of a crucial battle.  These kinds of events meant that people's lives were forever changed and transformed.  Is it any wonder, then, that both of these words found their way into the Christian expression of the Incarnation?</p>
				
				<h2>ADVENT IN ITS FINAL FORM</h2>
				<p>Although the countries of Western and Northern Europe already had a form of Advent for some two centuries, it wasn't until the mid-500s that Rome itself began to observe this season.  Eventually, the latter part of the four weeks of Advent in Rome was marked by a more intense time of expectation, fasting, and prayer from 17 to 24 December.  Finally, in the High Middle Ages (13<sup>th</sup> &amp; 14<sup>th</sup> centuries), Advent was characterised by the strong eschatological message of the glorious return of the Lord at the end of time.  It was this fully developed form of the season that spread rapidly throughout Europe.</p>
				
				<h2>AN ADVENT OVERVIEW</h2>
				
				<p>Today the four weeks of Advent develop certain dominant themes which can be described as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>1<sup>st</sup> week:</b> Watch and Pray: Vigilant waiting for the Lord's coming</li>
					<li><b>2<sup>nd</sup> week:</b> John the Baptist's challenge:  Prepare the way of the Lord!</li>
					<li><b>3<sup>rd</sup> week:</b> The Messianic Age is here:  Therefore, Rejoice!</li>
					<li><b>4<sup>th</sup> week:</b> The Incarnation of the Word:  God's plan set in motion</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>We can also look at the unfolding of Advent in two phases:</p>
				
				<h2>PHASE ONE - from the First Sunday of Advent until 16 December</h2>
				<p>In a broad sweep and with stirring words of warning issued against the backdrop of stark signs in nature and in the unfolding of human social history, Advent focuses on the two Comings of Christ:  his 1<sup>st</sup> Coming when he took on our own human nature and lived among us; his 2nd Coming when he will appear as Judge at the end of time.  The point is that even in the midst of a long history of turmoil and upheaval there is embedded in the human heart and soul a longing for the Messiah and the expectancy of his coming.</p>
				
				<p>The Catechism of the Catholic Church expresses this as follows:</p>
				
				
				<p class="quote">
					<i class="icon fwicon-quotes"></i>
					<i><sup>524</sup> When the Church celebrates the Liturgy of Advent each year, she makes present this ancient expectancy of the Messiah, for by sharing in the long preparation for the Saviour's first coming, the faithful renew their ardent desire for his second coming.  By celebrating the precursor's (John the Baptist's) birth and martyrdom, the Church unites herself to his desire: "he must increase, but I must decrease."</i>

				</p>
								
				
				<h2>PHASE TWO - from 17 December to 24 December</h2>
				<p>By contrast to Phase One, this eight day period is far more personal as it focuses on the persons and events leading up to the actual birth of the Saviour in Bethlehem.  It is crystal-clear that the underlying theme is that God's own Son has taken on human nature to live among us in order to lead us back to God where we truly belong.</p>
				<p>On each of these eight days, the 1<sup>st</sup> readings are from Old Testament and trace the prophetic development of God's promise to send us the Messiah.  The Gospel of Day 1 (17 December) presents us with the genealogy of Jesus Christ, Son of God, complete with a truly human (and problematic) ancestry, a Gospel so important that it is repeated on the Vigil of the Nativity.</p>
				<p>Then in a series of "annunciations" the details of God's plan are revealed and set in motion:  the annunciation to Joseph, to Zechariah, and then to Blessed Mary, together with the aftermath of this extraordinary sequence of events:  John's witness to Jesus' presence in the flesh and Mary's Magnificat.  This whole period of prelude culminates in the Forerunner John the Baptist's own Nativity and the proclaiming of the Benedictus (that "God has visited his people").</p>
				
				<h2>THE "O" ANTIPHONS</h2>
				<p>Woven into these special days is a series of seven ancient antiphons, called the "O" Antiphons, which can be easily missed but which express the Church's faith in what the Messiah means to us.  Their authorship is unknown but they were already in use in the 700s.  In our present liturgical plan they are used at Mass as verses before the Gospel and in the Divine Office as Magnificat antiphons for Evening Prayer.  Here are three of these beautiful antiphons:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><b>O Wisdom,</b> you come forth from the mouth of the Most High.  You fill the universe and hold all things together in a strong yet gentle manner.  O come to teach us the way of truth. (17 December)</li>
					<li><b>O Adonai</b> and Leader of Israel, you appeared to Moses in a burning bush and you gave him the Law on Sinai.  O Come and save us by your mighty power.  (18 December)</li>
					<li><b>O Immanuel,</b> you are our King and Judge, the One whom the people await and their Saviour.  O Come and save us, Lord our God.  (23 December)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>SUMMARISING THE ADVENT THEMES</h2>
				
				<ol>
					<li><b>Preparing to accept "Good News":</b>  The Canticle of the Angels (Lk 2:14) is the Church's profound Christmas proclamation.  Advent must prepare us in such a way that this Good News, when it is proclaimed in the Church, is accepted and taken to heart.</li>
					<li><b>Appreciating the mystery of the Word made flesh:</b>  That the divine Son of God actually took on our own human nature is the foundation of our entire faith.  But appreciating the humanity of Jesus the Christ really depends upon how we understand and appreciate our own human nature.  In the course of a year so many things happen to shake our faith in the human condition and its destiny.  Advent is a prime time for correcting this negative bias and checking our fundamental basis for hope.</li>
					<li><b>A recommitment to justice and mercy:</b>  The urgent cry of John the Baptist can be heard throughout the Advent season, "Prepare the way of the Lord!  Make straight his paths!"  The vigilance and watchfulness called for here does not entail an increase in personal anxiety or spiritual pressure.  It flows out of our Baptismal and Confirmational sense of responsibility for our world, for love of the person, and our commitment to practical justice and mercy "as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Saviour Jesus Christ".</li>
					<li><b>The Advent response of baptismal conversion of heart:</b> As we have seen, Advent had its beginnings in the celebration of Baptism as the rising of the Light of God's face shining in the face of Jesus.  Our 21st century Advent likewise is a call to conversion of heart and true reconciliation as we turn from the inherent darkness to embrace this Light.</li>
