			<p><sup>12</sup>&nbsp;But we appeal to you, brothers and sisters, to respect those who labour among you, and have charge of you in the Lord and admonish you;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;And we urge you, beloved, to admonish the idlers, encourage the faint hearted, help the weak, be patient with all of them.<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;See that none of you repays evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to all. </p>
            <p><sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Rejoice always,<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;pray without ceasing,<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Do not quench the Spirit.<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Do not despise the words of prophets,<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;but test everything; hold fast to what is good;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;abstain from every form of evil. </p>
            <p><sup>23</sup>&nbsp;May the God of peace himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept sound and blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do this.<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Beloved, pray for us.<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss.<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;I solemnly command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all of them.<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. </p>
