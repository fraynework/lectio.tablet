			<p>It has become customary to send a birthday card congratulating the person who is marking another year of life, and although Christmas is often referred to as Jesus' birthday, no one is so naive as to mail cards to him. Rather, believers celebrate the Christmas event by mailing cards to one another. Upon reflection (and without a nod to the commercial pressures exerted by the greeting card industry), this seems an appropriate custom -- particularly when the cards are genuine in their expression of the true spirit of the season. The birth of Jesus Christ is the source of our joy; the annual remembrance of the coming of God into human history gives rise to the mutual greetings we extend. By our cards and gifts, we are, saying to one another, 'Congratulations; we are the people with whom God has chosen to live!'</p>
            <p>Today's gospel, taken from the Lucan infancy narrative, is a greeting card of sorts, a birth announcement, addressed to an expectant world. A son is to be born; his name shall be Jesus. But, unlike contemporary birth announcements, which usually detail only the physical particulars (weight, length) of the child, and the day and time of the birth, the news of Jesusâ€™ birth was accompanied by an indication of his <i>purpose</i> and <i>mission</i> in life.</p>
            <p>Similar examples of this literary genre can be found in the Hebrew Scriptures (birth announcements of Isaac, Sampson, Samuel) and in the secular literature of the Greco-Roman world (e.g. Plutarch's treatment of Coriolanus). However, Luke's annunciation of the birth of Jesus makes it clear that this unique nativity proclamation was far superior to other stories of its genre. Luke used a similar literary technique in telling of the birth of Jesus' precursor, John (Luke 1:5-25); he created two announcements of equal lengths, which contained the same basic elements. But, as Raymond E. Brown (<i>The Birth of the Messiah,</i> Image Books, Doubleday, New York: 1979), has explained, Luke's parallel accounts underscore the wondrous nature of Jesus' birth (not born in usual fashion) and the unique but subordinate position of John.</p>
            <p>Whereas Jesus would be 'great and Son of the Most High God' (1:32), John was described as one who would be 'great in the sight of the Lord' (1:15). And while John was conceived of the union of Zechariah and Elizabeth (1:13), Jesus' birth was attributed by the evangelist to the power of the Most High (1:35). John's mission would be to 'prepare a people fit for the Lord' (1:17) but Jesus would be the promised son of David whose rule and kingdom would never end (1:32-33). What God had pledged to David (first reading), concerning his everlasting dynasty, was to come to full flower in Jesus' person and mission.</p>
            <p>In the greeting of the angelic messenger, 'Rejoice, O, highly favoured daughter! The Lord is with you' (v. 28), Luke signals to his readers that the era of the messiah is dawning. Zephaniah (3:14-17) had extended a similar greeting to Israel, daughter of Zion, declaring, 'Yahweh, your king is in your midst!' The prophet and his contemporaries believed that the greeting would be fully realized, i.e. God would be truly with the people, when the messiah finally appeared. By addressing Mary in this manner, the angelic messenger was, in effect, declaring that the prophecies of Zephaniah and Isaiah (7:14, Immanuel-God-with-us!) were being fulfilled.</p>
            <p>Mary's acceptance of the birth announcement, 'I am the maidservant . . . let it be done to me as you say' (v. 38) casts her in the same light as that of the remnant or poor ones of Israel (<i>anawim</i>) whose lives were lived in total trust and dependence on God. Mary's faith, as described by Luke, makes her realistic and appealing; readers of the gospel are told that she was 'deeply troubled and wondered' at the message revealed to her (1:29). She questioned (1:34) and at times did not understand (2:50) but, all the while she trusted and pondered in her heart (2:51) as to her role and the role of her son in God's saving plan.</p>
            <p>From the outset, Luke offers the figure of Mary as a model disciple, i.e. as one who hears the word of God and makes a conscious decision to live accordingly. Advent believers need not summon any maudlin sentimentality for her. Mary worked through the difficulties in her life; despite confusion and without fully comprehending all the ramifications, she remained committed, in faith. Because of her faith, she had the joy of knowing where God lives.</p>
