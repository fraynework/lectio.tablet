			<p><sup>6</sup>&nbsp;There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;He came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;He himself was not the light, but he came to testify to the light.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>&nbsp;This is the testimony given by John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, 'Who are you?'<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;He confessed and did not deny it, but confessed, 'I am not the Messiah.<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;And they asked him, 'What then? Are you Elijah?' He said, 'I am not.' 'Are you the prophet?' He answered, 'No.'<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;Then they said to him, 'Who are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?'<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;He said, 'I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the Lord,'' as the prophet Isaiah said.<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;They asked him, 'Why then are you baptising if you are neither the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;John answered them, 'I baptise with water. Among you stands one whom you do not know,<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;the one who is coming after me; I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandal.'<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;This took place in Bethany across the Jordan where John was baptising.</p>
