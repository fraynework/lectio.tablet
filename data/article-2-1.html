			<p>In Advent we prepare to celebrate the greatest miracle we will ever encounter, the miracle of our Lord and Saviour taking on our humanity.</p>
            <p><sup>1s</sup>&nbsp;Isaiah and John the Baptist call on us to tear down our mountains and fill in our valleys to make straight the path of Our Lord. Our valleys are the times when we do not live as Jesus has taught us. Our mountains are times when we live against those teachings. We are to make level the uneven ground of our lives turning our rough places into a plain. We are to make straight the path of Our Lord to our hearts and our souls.</p>
            <p>2,000 years ago John the Baptist strode out of the desert proclaiming to all who would listen that they were to make low their mountains and lift up their valleys. John was a wild looking figure. He wore camel skin clothes and a thick brown belt. He had wild hair and a wild, bushy beard. His eyes fixed his audience with a fierce gaze. His language was uncompromising. 'The ground of your lives is uneven. The places of your lives are rough! Make straight the path of Our Lord!'
            <p>It is by no co-incidence that John bore a remarkable resemblance to the great prophet Elijah, wearing the same clothes Elijah wore. It is no co-incidence that John spoke fiercely in an uncompromising manner as did Elijah. It is no co-incidence that John baptised at Bethany over the Jordan where Elijah had ascended to heaven in a fiery chariot.</p>
            <p>John was saying, 'Look at me, look at me! Like Elijah I have something important to say. Listen or suffer the consequences! Make straight the path of the Lord!'</p>
            <p>In our second reading St Peter reminds us that our Lord will patiently wait until each of us tear down our mountains and lift up our valleys. In our first reading Isaiah reminds us that Our Lord will feed us, gather us in his arms, carry us and gently lead us. We are his sheep. He is our shepherd. He knows us each by name. Our shepherd will climb our mountains and descend into our valleys, to carry us and lead us to the 'new heavens and the new earth, where righteousness dwells.' Our Shepherd will not let any of his sheep perish.</p>
            <p>2,000 years ago John heralded Jesus the Christ, the Son of the Living God, whose sandals he was not fit to untie. 30 years before then, the stars heralded the birth of Jesus, the angels sang his glory, the shepherds told all who listen that he was born and the animals whose manger he shared lowed gently. Creation knelt at the crib of our Lord and Saviour, marvelling at the miracle of his birth.</p>
            <p>Today we who share in the baptism of Jesus the Christ, baptised with the Spirit not just water, kneel in worship of Our Lord and God, who has taken on our humanity so we may share in his Divinity. We tear down our mountains and fill in our valleys, making our rough places level. We make straight the path of Our Lord. Do we?</p>
