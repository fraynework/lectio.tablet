			<p>Welcome into Advent as we prepare for the coming of Emmanuel, when God will be with us to dwell among us. It has long been the human heart's desire to know God ever more intimately. Such yearnings are echoed in today's Reading from Is 64:1, 'O that you would tear open the heavens and come down.' Yet what is it that we anticipate in God's approach? What is it we want from God? What is it that we deeply need? Once again let us return to Is 64:8 where we read, 'we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.' The desire of the human heart is to knowits Creator ever more intimately. In this Advent we hope to be made more into the image of God. Advent is a time to prepare ourselves for change, so that God can work in us, recreating us in love and spirit</p>
			<p>Advent is a necessary time in all our lives as we often stray from our purpose and we forget the essence of our life, which is Emmanuel, God with us. Advent is a time to openly recall how much we need God in our midst. Advent invites us to prepare among humanity, place of welcome and hospitality, where God can be. As 1 Cor. 1:9 reminds us, 'God is faithful; by him you were called  into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.' To be in fellowship with Jesus, however, is also to be in fellowship with all people. In Advent, preparation for Christmas is a universal event, where we as one Church, from one end of the earth to the other, gather to welcome Emmanuel. Yet Advent is only the beginning for when Jesus comes we are transformed and our union with God is forever ongoing and reflected in our relationship with all. This is achieved through the gift of grace given to us in God, 'for in every way you have been enriched in him, in speech and knowledge of every kind' (1 Cor 1:5). Thus Christmas is the acknowledgment that in the coming of Emmanuel, we are all one with God, we are all brothers and sisters in Christ.</p>
			<p>So 'Beware, keep alert; for you do not know when the time will come' as we read in Mk 13:33. We have Advent to help us prepare to receive a gift that will transform our entire lives, a preparation where we are moulded by our Creator to become people of peace and joy. Advent reminds us how wonderful the coming of Emmanuel is and it reminds us to partake in this great event, to gladlyprepare and be ready for a God who will grace us with every blessing.</p>
