			<p><b>7</b>&nbsp;Now when the king was settled in his house, and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies around him,<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;the king said to the prophet Nathan, "See now, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of God stays in a tent."<sup>3</sup>Nathan said to the king, "Go, do all that you have in mind; for the LORD is with you."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;But that same night the word of the LORD came to Nathan:<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Go and tell my servant David: Thus says the LORD: Are you the one to build me a house to live in?<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Now therefore thus you shall say to my servant David: Thus says the LORD of hosts: I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep to be prince over my people Israel;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, so that they may live in their own place, and be disturbed no more; and evildoers shall afflict them no more, as formerly,<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover the LORD declares to you that the LORD will make you a house.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come forth from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me. When he commits iniquity, I will punish him with a rod such as mortals use, with blows inflicted by human beings.<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me; your throne shall be established forever.</p>
