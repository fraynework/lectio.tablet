			<p><sup>26</sup>&nbsp;In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was Mary.<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;And he came to her and said, "Greetings, favoured one! The Lord is with you.'<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;But she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what sort of greeting this might be.<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;The angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God.<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus.<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David.<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end."<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, since I am a virgin?"<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;The angel said to her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called Son of God.<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;And now, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren.<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;For nothing will be impossible with God."<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;Then Mary said, "Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word." Then the angel departed from her. </p>
