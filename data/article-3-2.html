			<h1 class="deco">Isaiah 61:1-2, 10-11</h1>
			<p><b>61</b>&nbsp;The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me; he has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and release to the prisoners;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;to proclaim the year of the Lord's favour, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn. <br>
<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my whole being shall exult in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;For as the earth brings forth its shoots, and as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up, so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations.</p>
