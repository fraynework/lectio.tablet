			<p>A favourite carol for Midnight Mass begins,</p>
			<p> <i>"It came upon a midnight clear<br />that glorious song of old...<br />The world in solemn stillness lay<br />to hear the angels sing."</i></p>
            <p>Quiet, clear air, crispness, stillness, peaceâ€¦are images which console and caress us.</p>
                <p>God's zeal for our welfare (Isa 9:7), the appearance of the grace of God (Titus 2:11)
God's promise of peace (Lk2:14), are assurances of great joy and fullness of life to come.</p>
				<p>However, the readings for this liturgy are disturbing in their content, and it is important that our hunger for certitude and peace does not blind us to the reality that this kingdom of righteousness is a reality in the now only as we cooperate with the power of God's Spirit. (Titus 3:7)</p>
                <p><b>Isaiah 9:2-7</b>&nbsp;Isaiah the prophet, looks with hope to the leadership of a small nation facing military invasion and the tensions of diplomatic and political intrigues. The people walking in the darkness of injustice and oppression will be enlightened and freed by a ruler to come who will establish justice and peace. But the establishment and continuance of the godly kingdom by this king, counselor and father, only grows as much as people respond to his gracious authority. An emphasis in Isaiah is that pride is the great sin: the prophet calls for true enlightenment and knowledge of the Lord through wise judgment and holy justice. These are the virtues that take the people out of darkness, and along the road of light.</p>
                <p><b>Titus 2:11-14</b>&nbsp;The letter to Titus looks towards the establishment of the kingdom also, perhaps anticipating its coming sooner than later. But however long we wait, we are to accept the training (knowledge and wisdom) offered to us through the grace of the Spirit. Then comes the disturbing challenge: we are to renounce one way of life and become self-controlled and upright. So, in the still of midnight worship, there are hard demands made on us to respond to Christ who "gave himself for us".</p>
                <p><b>Luke 2:1-14</b>&nbsp;In a world dominated by one of the bloodiest political and military systems in written history, the people of Palestine were ordered to be registered, that all the world was to be recorded as owned by Rome. But, a parallel kingdom was being revealed to the world in the little town of Bethlehem. This was realm of the Savior, the Messiah, whose ownership was liberating (good news) and fulfilling (great joy) to all people. It's worthwhile just considering these contrasting participants in the story: Emperor Augustus, Governor Quirinius of Syria, with the carpenter, his peasant wife, baby child and, possibly vagrant, shepherds. The two announcements are also telling us something: a decree that went out from the Emperor that all should be registered and the angel, saying "do not be afraid...I am bringing good news of a savior". There really is no question of which kingdom we must choose, is there?</p>
                 <p>As we are sent out from midnight Mass, we can treasure these words, praising God for what we have heard and seen.</p>
