			<p><sup>8</sup>&nbsp;But do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like one day.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;The Lord is not slow about his promise, as some think of slowness, but is patient with you, not wanting any to perish, but all to come to repentance.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fire, and the earth and everything that is done on it will be disclosed. </p>
            <p><sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way, what sort of persons ought you to be in leading lives of holiness and godliness, 12waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set ablaze and dissolved, and the elements will melt with fire?<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;But, in accordance with his promise, we wait for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness is at home.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, beloved, while you are waiting for these things, strive to be found by him at peace, without spot or blemish.</p>
