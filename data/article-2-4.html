            <p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;As it is written in the prophet Isaiah,</p>
            <p>See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,<br>who will prepare your way;<br><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;the voice of one crying out in the wilderness:<br>'Prepare the way of the Lord,<br>
make his paths straight,'</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;John the baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;And people from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him, and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Now John was clothed with camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;He proclaimed, 'The one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.</p>
