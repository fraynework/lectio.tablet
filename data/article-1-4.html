			<p><sup>33</sup>&nbsp;Beware, keep alert; for you do not know when the time will come.<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his slaves in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch.<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, keep awake-for you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrow, or at dawn,<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;or else he may find you asleep when he comes suddenly.<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;And what I say to you I say to all: Keep awake.</p>
