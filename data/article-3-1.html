			<p>Two weeks to go and Christmas will be upon us. Today is <i>Gaudate</i> Sunday which means rejoicing Sunday. Originally Advent was longer than it now is and was a time of penance as well as of prayer and preparation. The Church decided we should have a day off, a day of celebration in the middle of our time of penance. Some priests will wear pink to highlight the different flavour of this Sunday from the other Sundays of Advent.</p>
            <p>In our first reading from Isaiah we read that, 'The Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all nations.' In our second reading from Paul's first letter to the Thessalonians we are encouraged to, 'Rejoice always, to greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss.' Very much party mode! We greet each other with a kiss and rejoice as our Lord God brings righteousness to our world and our lives.</p>
            <p>But we have to prepare for this party. There is work to do. We are to 'bring good news to the oppressed, bind up the broken hearted, proclaim liberty to captives and release to prisoners, to comfort all who mourn.' St Paul exhorts us to 'be at peace, encourage the faint heartened, help the weak, be patient, always seek to do good, pray without ceasing.' We are preparing to party with the Lord. The 'we' is you, me and all of God's children. </p>
            <p>To be ready to party in righteousness we are to feed the hungry, give water to the thirsty, clothe the naked, visit the lonely and care for the elderly and sick. We are to speak for the voiceless. Everyone is invited to this party and it is our job to make sure they make it.</p>
            <p>John was not a party animal. He was also not the Light, not the Messiah, not Elijah and <b>not</b> the Prophet (he was a prophet but <b>not</b> the prophet). He told the priests and Levites that he wasn't any of those things. Rather he was the voice in the wilderness, the baptiser, the witness to the light.</p>
            <p>Jesus the Christ is the Light. He is the Way, the Truth and the Life. He is the Good Shepherd. He is the Christ, the Son of the Living God. The party we are preparing for is in his honour. He is the guest of honour. He is the Host, from whom we receive the gift of eternal life. Although Jesus came after John in time, he preceded John, he succeeded John and he raised John from the dead by his death and resurrection.</p>
            <p>John told us to get ready for the party to end all parties. Jesus is coming. When he does, you, me and all his brothers and sisters, our brothers and sisters will celebrate in our Father's many roomed home. What a party that will be!</p>
